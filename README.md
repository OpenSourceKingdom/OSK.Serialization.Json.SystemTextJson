# OSK.Serialization.Json.SystemTextJson
The library provides an integration of an `IJsonSerializer` that utilizes the System.Text.Json namespace. This serializer can be accessed via dependency injection or by creating a new `SystemTextJsonSerializer`.
Dependency injection can be added using the `AddSystemTextJsonSerialization` service collection extension.
